The bill sets out several exceptions to such prohibition,  including protective facial coverings to protect against disease, infection,  and exposure to toxic substances and facial coverings worn  by any law-enforcement officer assigned to a special weapons and tactics  team while engaged in the performance of his official duties with such team.  The bill subjects the law-enforcement officer to  disciplinary action, including dismissal, demotion, suspension, transfer, or  decertification, and creates a Class 1 misdemeanor for any  law-enforcement officer who wears a facial covering in violation of the  provisions of the bill unless the law-enforcement agency that employs such  law-enforcement officer has adopted and established a written policy for and  restrictions on the use of facial coverings. The  bill also directs the Department of Criminal Justice Services to develop a  model policy for and restrictions on the use of  facial coverings by law-enforcement officers.  Finally, the bill creates a civil cause of action for any  person injured as a result of tortious conduct by a law-enforcement officer who  knowingly and intentionally wears a facial covering in violation of the  provisions of the bill.
